      "description": "\nIf a biography is read before describing the policy of a miraculous personality like Chanakya, it will become easier to understand his policy. That's why Chanakya's biography is given earlier in this book. It is not a scripture, but a summary of the experiences of the entire worldly life. It is as relevant today, as it was 2000 years ago. Chanakya's policy which makes life easier also provides proper answers to all the questions of life.",
